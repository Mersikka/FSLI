# FSLI (WIP)
A really early work-in-progress rearl-time Finnish Sign Language Interpreter utilizing a self trained LSTM action recognition model.

Initially I will most likely only be implementing alphabet recognition, but I might expand on the functionality later.

## To-Do
- [ ] Implement UI for the convenient gathering of training data
- [ ] Gather sufficient training data for the alphabet
- [ ] Train the model
- [ ] Possibly self-host the model
